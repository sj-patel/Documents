# Welcome!

This is a basic example of documentation. It is intended as a showcase of some of the
features that TechDocs provides out of the box.

You can see also:

- [A sub page](sub-page.md)
- [Inline code examples](code/code-sample.md)
- [Plugin & Extension examples](extensions.md) - Diagrams, emojis, visual formatting.

## Basic Markdown

## Here is a bulleted list:

- Item one
  - sub item
- Item two
- Item Three
